120

This is a silent concurrency limit. You can't set it above 65000. Many
systems have a "hidden limit" of 509, because a single process cannot
have more than 1023 handles open at once, and each concurrent delivery
uses two handles. If you set it any higher than your system's "hidden
limit", qmail will refuse to compile.
